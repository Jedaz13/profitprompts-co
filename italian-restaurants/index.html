      <h2>What if your restaurant could run like the busy places &mdash; without you becoming a marketing expert?</h2>
      <p>Here's the thing: the restaurants that are packed every night aren't doing anything magical. They just figured out a few simple systems &mdash; getting more reviews, staying in touch with regulars, filling slow nights with smart promotions.</p>
      <p>The problem was always time. Who's going to write all those emails, posts, and texts when you're already working 70 hours?</p>
      <p>That's what changed. Free AI tools can now do in 5 minutes what used to take a marketing person 5 hours. You just need someone to show you exactly how &mdash; in plain English, step by step.</p>

       ============================================ -->
  <section class="profitability section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Are You Actually Making Money &mdash; Or Just Staying Busy?</h2>
      <p>Here's a hard truth most restaurant owners don't want to hear:</p>
      <p class="profitability-highlight">You can fill every table on Friday and Saturday and still lose money.</p>
      <p>If your food cost is running at 38% instead of 30%, that's thousands of dollars walking out the back door every month. If you're overstaffing slow nights, that's another leak. If your regulars aren't coming back because you never stay in touch &mdash; that's the biggest leak of all.</p>
      <p><strong>Week 1 of this playbook starts here.</strong> Before any marketing, we show you how to use AI to:</p>
      <div class="profitability-points">
        <div class="profitability-point"><span class="profitability-arrow">&rarr;</span> Calculate your real food cost percentage (most owners are guessing)</div>
        <div class="profitability-point"><span class="profitability-arrow">&rarr;</span> Find out your actual labor cost per cover on slow vs. busy nights</div>
        <div class="profitability-point"><span class="profitability-arrow">&rarr;</span> See where money is leaking &mdash; and plug the holes before you spend a dime on marketing</div>
      </div>
      <p>Because there's no point getting more customers through the door if every plate you serve is losing money.</p>
      <p><strong>Then we build from there</strong> &mdash; getting you more reviews, more regulars, more catering gigs, and fuller slow nights. But the numbers come first.</p>

          <h3>Know Your Numbers (Before You Spend a Dime)</h3>
          <p>Use AI to calculate your real food cost %, labor cost per cover, and prime cost. Most owners are guessing &mdash; and guessing wrong. This is where you find the money you're already losing.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Set up a simple system: a QR code on the table, an automatic follow-up text, and done. More reviews = showing up first when someone searches "Italian food near me" = more walk-ins you didn't have to pay for.</p>

          <p>Tuesdays don't have to be ghost towns. We'll help you create a weekly special, get the word out to your regulars with a quick text and social post, and track the results. Most owners see a noticeable bump within 2 weeks.</p>

          <p>Set up a simple "VIP text list" where you send one message a week. A quick "Nonna's meatballs are back tonight" text to 200 regulars beats any Instagram ad. AI writes the messages &mdash; you just hit send.</p>

          <p>AI writes outreach messages to local businesses, wedding planners, and corporate offices. Plus a simple catering menu template and follow-up sequence. One $3,000 catering gig pays for this playbook 60x over.</p>

          <p>Every tactic in this playbook is based on what the most profitable restaurants in America are already doing. We didn't invent anything new &mdash; we just made it easy for you to do the same thing in 30 minutes a week instead of 30 hours.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Each week in the playbook targets one of these proven leverage points. The AI just makes execution fast.</p>

          <h3>What Changed: This Used to Cost $3,000/Month</h3>
          <p>Two years ago, doing everything in this playbook would mean hiring a marketing agency &mdash; $2,000 to $5,000 a month &mdash; or spending 15+ hours a week learning it yourself.</p>
          <p>Today, free AI tools can write your review responses, create your social posts, draft your emails, and build your promotional materials in minutes. You just need someone to show you exactly what to type in. That's what this playbook does.</p>

        <div class="about-text">
          <p>Hey, I'm Gedas.</p>
          <p>Before I built ProfitPrompts, I was the Lead Digital Marketing Manager for one of the largest entertainment destinations in Europe &mdash; a resort with a restaurant, hotel, spa, and adventure park. I was responsible for all marketing across every venue.</p>
          <p>The biggest win? We turned winter &mdash; traditionally the dead season &mdash; into a peak revenue period that matched summer numbers. That meant more tables filled, more rooms booked, and more revenue across the board. I know what it takes to fill a restaurant when nobody's walking in the door.</p>
          <p>Since then, I've built 3 content brands that grew to over 500,000 subscribers and 100 million views. I've run ad campaigns, built sales funnels, and automated systems across multiple businesses &mdash; and I've had plenty of failures along the way too.</p>
          <p>Here's what I noticed: the AI tools I use every day could save restaurant owners an enormous amount of time and money. But most owners don't know where to start, and the "marketing gurus" online are selling generic advice that doesn't apply to running a real restaurant.</p>
          <p>So I built this playbook. Every template is specific to Italian restaurants. Every strategy is based on what actually works. And the whole system is designed so someone who's never used AI can follow along in 30 minutes a week.</p>
          <p>If it doesn't work for you, email me and I'll refund every penny. I'd rather have a happy customer than keep $47 from someone who didn't get value.</p>

            <p>Not at all. If you can send a text message and search on Google, you can follow this playbook. Every step is explained in plain English with screenshots. No coding, no fancy software &mdash; just copy, paste, and customize.</p>

            <p>Most restaurant owners see their first wins &mdash; more reviews, more engagement from regulars &mdash; within the first 2 weeks. Revenue impact from fuller slow nights and new catering clients typically builds over 30&ndash;60 days.</p>

            <p>Yes. We designed this specifically for restaurant owners, not tech people. If you can type a text message, you can do this. Every prompt is copy-and-paste &mdash; just fill in your restaurant's name and details.</p>
